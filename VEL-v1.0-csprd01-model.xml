    <abstract>
      <para>The Variability Exchange Language (VEL) enables the exchange of
      variability information among tools for variant management tools and
      systems development tools. VEL eliminates the cost of building
      customized interfaces by defining a standard way for information to be
      exchanged among corresponding tools. Using VEL, a variant management
      tool is able to read the variability from a development tool and pass
      configurations of selected system features to a development tool.</para>

      <para>By defining a common variability data interface that can be
      implemented by both the development tools and the variant management
      tools, VEL enables a continuous development process for variable systems
      and more flexible use of tools.</para>

      <title>Section Prolog</title>
      <para>VEL is an interoperability standard that enables the exchange of
      variability information among variant management tools and systems
      development tools. The essential tasks of a variants management tool are
      to represent and analyze the variability of a system abstractly and to
      define system configurations by selecting the desired system features. A
      system development tool captures information of a specific kind, such as
      requirements, architecture, component design, or tests. In order to
      support the development of variable systems a development tool either
      has to offer the capability to express and deal with variability
      directly, or an adaptor must be provided that adds this capability to
      the development tool.</para>

      <para>To interconnect variants management with systems development the
      information exchange among the corresponding tools must be established.
      A variants management tool must be able to read or extract the
      variability from a development tool and to pass a configuration, i.e. a
      set of selected system features, to the development tool. Up to now the
      interfaces that support this information exchange are built for each
      development tool anew. With VEL&lt;emphasis&gt;,&lt;/emphasis&gt; a
      common interface is defined that can be implemented by both the
      development tools and the variants management tool, thus VEL eliminates
      the cost of building customized interfaces by defining a standard way
      for information to be exchanged between tools.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Variants Management, System Variability, and Variation
        Points</title>

        <para>Variants management is an activity that accompanies the whole
        system development process and, therefore, is orthogonal to the other
        development tasks. Like safety, security, and other system properties,
        variability cannot be built into a system at the end of the process.
        Rather, the desired variability has to be determined, analyzed,
        designed, implemented and tested continuously, starting at the very
        beginning of the process through to the final delivery of the system
        or the system variant respectively. That means that within each
        development stage &ndash; requirements analysis, design,
        implementation, test, documentation, etc. &ndash; variability is an
        aspect that has to be considered.</para>

        <para>We consider as variable system a system that can be tailored by
        the system producer according to individual clients&CloseCurlyQuote;
        needs. All variants of a variable system are developed within one
        development process. In addition to the standard development tasks the
        process must also provide the means to tailor the system, i.e. to
        derive the client specific variant of the system. This may happen at
        different stages, also known as (variance) binding times.</para>

        <para>Variability is embodied in variation points. Consider as example
        a requirements document. A requirement toward a variable system may be
        <emphasis>optional</emphasis>. In this case, two system variants can
        be formed by either selecting or deselecting the requirement. A set of
        requirements may be <emphasis>alternatives</emphasis>, then each
        selection of one of these requirements forms one system variant.
        Finally, a requirement may contain a <emphasis>parameter</emphasis>,
        and then each value that can be selected for this parameter yields a
        system variant.</para>

        <para>The same definition of variation points holds for all other
        artifacts that are created in the development process &ndash; be it
        analysis or design models such as the views defined in the meta model,
        test specifications, code, documentation, or whatever. In each
        artifact there may be optional elements, alternative elements, and
        parameterized elements.</para>

        <para>We do not specify here how these variation points are
        represented in the artifacts. Some artifact formats support the
        definition of variation points, in other cases appropriate means have
        to be added. This obviously also has an impact on the tools that are
        used to create and manage the artifacts. In some cases they are
        capable to express variation points. In other cases adaptors have to
        be built in order to incorporate variation points.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Variability View and Variants Management Tools</title>

        <para>It is an accepted best practice to define an explicit abstract
        variability view on a system under development to support variants
        management continuously throughout the process. This abstraction
        contains the bare information on the variability of the system. That
        means that it describes which variants exist, but does not describe
        how the variability is realized. The variability information is
        derived from an analysis of the commonalities, differences, and
        dependencies of the system&CloseCurlyQuote;s variants and is often
        represented as a feature model.</para>

        <para>A variants management tool supports the creation of an artifact
        &ndash; a variability model &ndash; that represents the abstract
        variability information. Moreover, it offers operations to select or
        deselect system features and via this feature configuration to specify
        the system&CloseCurlyQuote;s variants.</para>

        <para>The information of the variability view has to be connected with
        the system development artifacts in order to define how the feature
        selection (system configuration) determines the resolution of the
        variation points within these artifacts, i.e. the selection of a
        variation for each variation point. As soon as these connections are
        established a feature configuration can be carried over to a
        configuration of the variation points of the concerned artifact. The
        technical realization of this connection is addressed by the
        <emphasis>Variability Exchange Language</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>At present there is no standard that would define how variation
        points are expressed in different artifacts. That means that a tool
        supplier who builds a variants management tool has to implement an
        individual interface to each other tool that is used in a development
        process to create the corresponding artifacts. The purpose of the
        <emphasis>Variability Exchange Language</emphasis> is to support the
        standardization of these interfaces by a common exchange format that
        defines which information is exchanged between a variants management
        tool and a tool that is used to manage a specific kind of artifacts in
        a development process. As mentioned above, such a tool may either be a
        tool that already supports the definition of variation points for the
        concerned artifact type, or it may be an adaptor that adds this
        capability to a base tool.</para>

        <para>The <emphasis>Variability Exchange Language</emphasis> defines a
        requirement on tools or tool adaptors that intend to support variants
        management. Such a tool has to be able to extract the data that is
        defined in the <emphasis>Variability Exchange Language</emphasis> from
        the artifact that it manages and to incorporate the data that is sent
        from the variants management tool into this artifact. Beyond the
        exchange format, i.e. the contents of the information that is
        exchanged, also some basic operations are defined here. They define in
        which direction the variability information is intended to
        flow.</para>

        <para>A use case for the <emphasis>Variability Exchange
        Language</emphasis> can be defined as follows. Assume an artifact with
        variation points is given, for instance an artifact created with tool
        A in <xref linkend="_fig-velUseCase"/>. First the development tool has
        to collect the data defined in the <emphasis>Variability Exchange
        Language, </emphasis>essentially given by the variation points
        contained in the artifact. It passes this data to the variants
        management tool that builds a variability model based on the data. The
        variability model can be used to define a system configuration by
        selecting the desired system features. The corresponding data, i.e.
        the configuration, formatted according to the <emphasis>Variability
        Exchange Language</emphasis>, is passed back to the development tool
        or adaptor that uses this data to create or derive an artifact variant
        that corresponds to the system variant defined in the variants
        management tool.</para>

        <para>Applying this scenario to all development tools and artifacts
        yields a consistent set of development artifacts for any system
        variant automatically. The variation points that correspond to
        customer relevant system features should coincide in all artifacts,
        i.e. they always induce the same variability model in the variants
        management tool. In addition to that there may also be internal
        variation points, for instance implementation variants that do not
        alter the visible properties of the system but are relevant for the
        system construction process. These variation points give rise to a
        staged variability model in which customer features are separated from
        internal features.</para>

        <para>Since the system configuration is built once and for all in the
        variants management tool an identical configuration is passed to all
        development tools and thereby ensures consistency of the variants
        selection. It might only happen that internal features for instance
        are not interpreted by some development tool because it is not
        concerned with internal decisions, such as a requirements document or
        a system test.</para>

    <title>Overview of the Variability Exchange Language</title>

  <section>
    <title>Section Prolog</title>

    <para>The core of the <emphasis>Variability Exchange Language</emphasis>
    is given by the definition of variation points and their variations
    &ndash; by the classes <classname>VariationPoint</classname> and <classname>Variation</classname> (see <xref
    linkend="_Ref408311811"/>). In the following we immediately use the class
    names from the meta-model presented in Chapter <xref
    linkend="_sec-detailedSpec"/> to discuss the corresponding concepts, such
    as <classname>VariationPoint</classname> and <classname>Variation</classname>. This chapter gives a survey on the main
    classes, in particular the ones shown in <xref
    linkend="_Ref408311811"/>.</para>

    <para>A detailed specification of all classes is provided in Chapter <xref
    linkend="_sec-detailedSpec"/>.</para>

    <para>A Variability Exchange Language document starts with a
    <classname>VariabilityExchangeModels</classname> element, which contains a number of
    <classname>VariabilityExchangeModel</classname> elements. Each <classname>VariabilityExchangeModel</classname>
    corresponds to one (or possibly several, but this is implementation
    dependent) artefacts with variable elements.</para>

    <para>A <classname>VariabilityExchangeModel</classname> in turn contains a number of
    <classname>VariationPoint</classname>s. Thus, a <classname>VariabilityExchangeModel</classname> describes the variable
    aspects of an artifact, but only those. All non-variable facets of the
    artifact are discarded because they are not necessary for our
    purpose.</para>

    <section id="S-SUB-SECTION-TITLE">
      <title>VariationPoint and Variation</title>

      <para>As shown in <xref linkend="_Ref408311811"/>, we distinguish
      between two different kinds of <classname>VariationPoint</classname>s:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>StructuralVariationPoints are variation points where the
          structure of a model changes during the binding process.
          StructuralVariationPoints define which elements are contained in a
          bound artifact. There are two kinds of structural variation
          points:</para>

          <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
            <listitem>
              <para>OptionalStructuralVariationPoint &ndash; variation points
              that can be selected or deselected.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>XorStructuralVariationPoint &ndash; i.e. variation points
              that represent sets of alternatives from which exactly one can
              be selected.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>ParameterVariationPoints are variation points which select a
          numerical value for a parameter during the binding process. They do
          not change the structure of an artifact. There are two kinds of
          parameter variation points:</para>

          <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
            <listitem>
              <para>CalculatedParameterVariationPoint &ndash; variation points
              where the parameter value is calculated by an expression.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>XorParameterVariationPoint &ndash; variation points where
              the parameter value is selected from a list of values.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Each <classname>VariationPoint</classname> is associated with one or more <classname>Variation</classname>s. The
      <classname>Variation</classname>s enumerate the possible variants for their respective
      <classname>VariationPoint</classname>s. When an artifact is bound, then one of these variations
      (OptionalStructuralVariationPoints also allow zero variations here) is
      selected to be included in the bound artifact, and all others are
      discarded.</para>

      <para>Both <classname>Variation</classname>s and <classname>VariationPoint</classname>s may refer to artifact elements
      (<varname>correspondingVariableArtifactElement</varname>), for example the Simulink block
      or the line of code which correspond to the <classname>VariationPoint</classname> respectively
      Variation.</para>

      <para><classname>VariationPoint</classname>s can further define dependencies on other variation
      points (<classname>VariationDependency</classname>), for example one variation point may
      require another variation points. This is useful to express technical
      dependencies in artifacts.</para>

      <para>Furthermore, a <classname>VariationPoint</classname> may contain other <classname>VariationPoint</classname>s to
      establish a hierarchy (<classname>VariationPointHierarchy</classname>), similarly to subsystem
      blocks in Simulink or hierarchies in software architectures.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="_Ref409084549">
      <title>Variation Point Descriptions versus Variation Point
      Selections</title>

      <para>A <classname>VariabilityExchangeModel</classname> as defined in <xref
      linkend="_Ref408311811"/> can actually serve two different
      purposes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis>variation point description</emphasis> lists all
          variation points and <emphasis>all</emphasis> their variations; that
          is it describes a complete product line.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis>variation point description</emphasis> also lists
          all variation points, but selects one (or zero for optional
          variation points) Variation for each variation point. The attribute
          selected of Variation is used for that purpose. Any such selection
          must be consistent with the <varname>expression</varname> or condition attribute of a
          Variation, as well as with dependencies between variation
          points.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Both variation point descriptions and variation point selections
      use the same structure; the attribute type of <classname>VariabilityExchangeModel</classname>
      determines how a <classname>VariabilityExchangeModel</classname> should be interpreted.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Binding</title>

      <para>The <emphasis>Variability Exchange Language</emphasis> does not
      make any assumptions on how the binding process for the associated
      artifact works. We do however provide a way to attach Conditions or
      Expressions to <classname>Variation</classname>s:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>In a <classname>StructuralVariationPoint</classname>, a Variation comes with a
          Condition that determines whether the associated artifact element is
          part of a bound artifact.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In a <classname>ParameterVariationPoint</classname>, the Variation determines a value
          for the associated artifact element. This is done either by
          computing it (CalculatedVariation) or selecting from one of several
          values (<classname>ValueVariation</classname>).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In a variation point description (see section <xref
      linkend="_Ref409084549"/>) the result of the evaluation of a condition
      or expression in a Variation must be compatible with the attribute
      selected of a Variation. That is, if the attribute selected of a
      Variation has the value <emphasis>true</emphasis>, then its condition
      must also evaluate to <emphasis>true</emphasis>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Common Concepts</title>

      <para>Most classes in the <emphasis>Variability Exchange
      Language</emphasis> are based on the class <classname>Identifiable</classname>, which provides
      them with a name and a unique identifier. Identifable also provide a way
      to attach application-specific data (<classname>SpecialData</classname>) to elements in the
      <emphasis>Variability Exchange Language</emphasis>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>API</title>

      <para>In addition to the contents of the exchange format basic
      operations of a Variability Interface are defined in the class
      VariabilityAPI. These operations cover the following operations:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The import and export of <classname>VariabilityExchangeModels</classname></para>
        </listitem>

    <section>
      <title>Example</title>

      <figure id="_fig-exampleSource">
        <title>Example source code with C-preprocessor directives</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>To demonstrate the applicability of the Variability Exchange
      Language for the exchange of variability information, we show as an
      example a simple source code section in Figure <xref
      linkend="_fig-exampleSource"/>, in which the C-preprocessor (cpp) is
      employed to realize variability, and the extract of that variability
      defined according to Variability Exchange Language (see <xref
      linkend="_fig-exampleVEL"/>). We could have used further artifact types
      like requirements, UML models, tests, etc. but for the sake of
      simplicity and understandability we opted for C-source code using the
      cpp.</para>

      <figure id="_fig-exampleVEL">
        <title>Example source code with C-preprocessor directives</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata contentdepth="777" contentwidth="605"
                       fileref="Figures/example-vel.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>To note, the cpp is a stand-alone tool for text processing, which,
      although initially invented for C, is not limited to a specific language
      and can be used for arbitrary text and source code transformations
      leading e.g. to conditional code compilation. The cpp tool works on the
      basis of directives (a.k.a. macros) that control syntactic program
      transformations. The directives supported by the cpp tool can be divided
      into four classes: file inclusion, macro definition, macro substitution,
      and conditional inclusion.</para>

      <para>In our example, we only use the macros <emphasis>A</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>B</emphasis> and conditional inclusion mechanisms. The source
      code comments in Figure <xref linkend="_fig-exampleSource"/> explain how
      the cpp will transform the code depending on the definition of the
      macros. From an abstract point of view, the code contains two variation
      points and three variations, which is reflected according to the
      Variability Exchange Language in the exchange format definition in <xref
      linkend="_fig-exampleVEL"/>. The first variation point spans the source
      lines 1-9 and contains two alternative variations. The variation point's
      corresponding elements of the artifact &ndash; in this case exactly the
      source lines &ndash; are represented in the exchange format as well.
      Regarding the variations, the first one (lines 2-6) will be selected if
      macro A is defined. Otherwise the second variation (line 8) gets
      selected. Assuming that the macro names are identically with features or
      at least there exists a mapping from a feature to a macro name, then the
      <emphasis>condition</emphasis> in the eighth line in <xref
      linkend="_fig-exampleVEL"/> is the equivalent to the first source code
      line.</para>

      <para>The [XMLmind] variation point (lines 3-5) is nested within the
      first variation of the first variation point, constituting a variation
      point hierarchy. Within the corresponding exchange format, the variation
      points are not nested but the nesting information is covered by the
      definition in the lines 15-17 in <xref linkend="_fig-exampleVEL"/>.
      There, the nested variation point is referenced by its
      <emphasis>id</emphasis>, resulting in a tree-like structure at the
      end.</para>

              <para>[FIXME] Then, the attribute <varname>id</varname> should have an identical value in

              <para>The attribute <varname>bindingTime</varname> defines the binding time of a

              <para>If a <classname>VariationPoint</classname> does not declare a <classname>BindingTime</classname>, then it
                is up to the binding process to define which binding time to use.
                For example, a process that uses a single binding time may not
                state an explicit binding time for its variation points.</para>

              <para>A <classname>VariationPoint</classname> may define more than one binding time. In
                this case, the attribute <varname>selected</varname> of the <classname>BindingTime</classname> elements
                decides which binding time is used in the actual binding
                process.</para>

            reference. This is because variation has an upper multiplicity
            greater than one, but XML attributes are restricted to an upper
            multiplicity of 1 (that is, an XML element may not have multiple
            elements with the same name).</para>
